### java-snake-game
A java swing based classic snake game with a twist

### Modes : 
- Three different game modes: Classic, Blocks, and AI.

- #### Classic One:
Simple Classic game that it's used to be.
- #### Blocks :
With each score , a block appears , increasing Difficulty.

- #### Automated Movement Logic :
Which allows snake to move automatically, dodging it's own body and the walls.<br>
It may not be fun to play with but was really fun to code.<br>
And to make it a fun thing to play with , changed gameplay a bit. <br>
**So instead of being snake , now we would be apple. And would have to run from the snake.**
I am calling this mode snakeChase and will add it in a branch snake-chase to this repo.
